So this is another try to scrape some Data from Instagram to analyse it 
in a nice and handy way.

I'm following this tutorial.  
https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/08/instagram-python-data-analysis.html

As the author is stating the official API is outdated so we'll be using the
unofficial one.

Which basically is: LevPasha's Unofficial Instagram API 
https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-API-python/blob/master/InstagramAPI/InstagramAPI.py

For visualization purposes we'll use Jupyter Notebooks / IPython which is quite new to me
but had always attract my interest because of the easier documentation as you can insert some 
text paragraphs for explanations. One of the reasons why it's called "Word for Geeks" I guess. 

After his tutorial hasn't worked out I've started to try working with this one right here

Which is generally also working with the unofficial API and Jupyter
